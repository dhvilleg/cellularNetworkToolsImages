# Welcome to Cellular Network Tools

Hi to all, i am very exited to introduce **cellular network tools project**, this app was develop to allow mobil phone users  being part of monitoring of quality of service QoS and quality of expirience QoE, this is possible because app get measures about cell signal state and internet speed while application is in use, later app upload data to a server in internet in order to get reports or quality pointers.

To see server project, look **https://github.com/dhvilleg/CellularNetworkToolsServer**


# Features
 - Get graphical information about cell signal , Cellular Network and service operator
